    ``systemd_sysusers`` now validates candidate rules with ``systemd-sysusers --dry-run``
    instead of applying runtime changes during module execution.

    ``systemd_sysusers`` no longer creates ``config_dir`` for ``state=absent`` and now
    honors check mode for directory creation.

    idempotency and absent/check-mode behavior.
